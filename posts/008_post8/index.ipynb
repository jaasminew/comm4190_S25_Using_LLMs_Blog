    "## Deep dive into the emotional aspect of human-generated ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring the product ideas that won the Kokuyo Design Award, I was deeply moved by the level of **humanistic consideration** embedded in each design. Regardless of the emotion they represent(or seek to address), whether love, sadness, anxiety, or curiosity, these ideas always stem from an **emotional core**, with the product concept perfectly capturing that feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a great example that illustrates this:\n",
    "This product is a watch designed for couples living in different time zones. Inspired by the frustration of coordinating across time differences, the watch elegantly solves this problem by visualizing two time zones within a single dial.\n",
    "\n",
    "While multi-time-zone watches are not uncommon, this design stands out due to its **ingenuity and emotional depth**. The designer’s thoughtful approach goes beyond functionality—it acknowledges the nuanced emotions of distance and connection, making the product feel deeply personal and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](humanistic-idea.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a \"recipe\" for generating ideas with humanistic touch and emotional depth, I started by analyzing several key aspects of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea originates from **an emotional core**: During brainstorming, we often generate numerous problem statements, but most remain surface-level, focusing on practical solutions rather than digging deeper into why the problem exists in the first place. However, a high-quality human-generated idea goes beyond simply accumulating advanced technology—it establishes a connection with the underlying emotional factors of the problem statement. This depth of understanding transforms a concept from merely functional to truly meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More than just designing a usable product, it creates a product that **seamlessly aligns with human habits and intuitions**. Humans rely on mental shortcuts, heuristics, and unconscious behaviors that shape how we interact with objects and technology. A well-designed product anticipates these natural tendencies, reducing cognitive load and making interactions feel effortless.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Sometimes) It incorporates a moment of delight by introducing subtle abnormalities into conventional details. When things follow predictable patterns, they can become mundane, fading into the background. A well-designed product, however, **breaks this expectation of normalcy**, sparking surprise and joy in the process. No matter how ordinary an object can be, a great product idea has the ability to add a playful touch to make it into a \"mini-game\"."
