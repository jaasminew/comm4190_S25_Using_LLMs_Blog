    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been intensively used in a lot of productivity settings, and they are notably good at data analysis, problem solving, and knowledge retrieval and synthesis.  While they are often assumed to be useful for idea generation, their actual strengths and limitations in producing original and feasible ideas remain underexplored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing inspiration from research on creativity in Artificial Intelligence tools, I set out to investigate LLMs’ capabilities in creative idea generation through a human-machine collaborative ideation session. Through multiple experiments, I aim to understand which collaborative role played by LLM is the most effective and inspring in the ideation setting."
